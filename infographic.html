     <h3>The Brief</h3> 
     
     <p>As part of my ‘Imaging and Data visualisation’ module in university I was required to design an infographic detailing a certain kind of population. This could be anything from country populations to certain demographics of people.I would have to visually present facts and figures using my design skills. </p>

        <div class="mydiv1">
        
               <img class="myimage1" src="images/infosketch.jpg"/>
               <h3>My Approach</h3>
        
        
        <p>I started this project by creating a mind map of all the different kinds of populations out there, country populations, minorities, animals etc. I got quite interested in different subsections of people in society for example the LGBT community, cyclists, and the one I was very interested in is vegans. I am vegan and I found that I don't often see a lot of information about this growing population of people. </p>
        <p> Veganism is one of the fastest growing social movements of the 21st century and I thought it would be very interesting to document that and given veganism's growing popularity it would be a current topic to report on.. So I began to gather my facts. I read many articles and reports about veganism and its progress over the last few decades and picked out the most interesting facts and figures that I thought I could present visually in an interesting way.</p>

          <div class="mydiv">

        <img class="myimage" src="images/eggplant.png"/>
 <p>Once I had all the facts and figures I wished to display on the infographic I began to sketch out illustrations and graphics that could be used to present the data. I wanted to use fruits and vegetables to visualise data and use imagery of greenery as well.<p>
        
            <p>I then started designing the graphics for the infographic on Illustrator. I was able to use the fruits and vegetbales in a ‘punny’ sort of way by using aubergines and cherries as a way to present males and females. The emojis of these are frequently used in reference to the male and female genetalia on social media. </p>
            
            <p>Creating the graphics for the associated facts became easier as I went along, picking an element that would be fun to illustrate and designing it to go with the information<p>
    </div>
            
 
           
          
        <div class="mydiv1">
        
               <img class="myimage1" src="images/grape.png"/><h3>Final Outcome</h3>
 <p>The finished outcome was a lengthy infographic detailing the rise of veganism, details about things like the percentages of men and women that are vegan and why people are going vegan. I kept a natural colour scheme through out keeping with the vegan vibe and my illustrations through out are simple shapes and lines. I think the inforgraphic gives a great insight into the topic at hand and makes the intake of information much easier and enjoyable. </p> 
        
        
       
        <p> I learned a lot about being able to translate information into a visual format. I loved being able to use my branding and design skills to create and infographic that was consistent in style and matched the topic at hand.
