     <h1>Beymoji</h1>
    <h2>The Brief</h2>
    <p>As part of my ‘Creative Entrepreneurship’ module in university I was tasked with creating a set of 12 icons that could possibly be sold to a company or used to make money in some way.</p>
    
    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>I originally started brainstorming icon set ideas thinking of ideas that could be used for apps or websites but nothing very original or inspiring to myself came to mind. I then started to brainstorm my own interests and hobbies to inspire more creative and out of the box thinking and I started to think about music and my favourite singer (Beyoncé).</p>

<p>In April of 2016 Beyoncé dropped Lemonade, her sixth . album, 12 tracks, accompanied by an hour-long film with a video for all 12 songs (12 videos, 12 icons... see my thinking?). Lemonade is a record breaking critically acclaimed piece of art that sold milions world wide and the associated tour grossed over $250 million. Lemonade is clearly an extremely profitable force so why not jump on the bandwagon!</p>

<p>When I began to design my screens on illustrator I first started with the illustrations I would have to do, I had to illustrate a landscape, then I was going to illustrate 4 example animals to show and finally I would have to design the icons for each screen. Once this was done I could get stuck into the actual screen formats and insert the illustrations where needed. Once the screens were designed I created a menu bar that would appear on the bottom of each screen and hold my 5 icons.
</p>
   
   <p>Finally I decided to give the app a brand to showcase its full potential. I created a logo for the app store icon and a word mark.</p>
    
    <h2>Final Outcome</h2>
    <p>I was very pleased with how the final screens looked, my colour scheme was strong and worked well with the branding. No screen looks out of place in terms of format . Looking forward I would like to start to actually develop this app and see it brough to life</p>
