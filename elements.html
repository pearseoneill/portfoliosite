     <h3>The Brief</h3> 
     
     <p>I was briefed to create a website educating children about five elements from the periodic table as part of my ‘Designing with Content’ module at university. The site would have to have a landing page displaying all 5 elements and then a page for each of the elements. </p>
     
        </div>
     
     
   
        <div class="mydiv1">
        
               <img class="myimage1" src="images/elementsketch.jpg"/>
               <h3>My Approach</h3>
 <p>I kick started this project by thinking about how I could make learning about elements fun for children. I thought that giving the website a theme could be fun, for example elements found in food, in the wild, in a hospital etc. I brainstormed a few ideas for themes and decided on making the website hospital themed. I could illustrate a hospital scene, medical instruments etc to make the knowledge the viewers are taking on more visual and memorable. I started to sketch out the format of the website and all the illustrations that the site would require so I could begin designing</p> 
        
        
        <p>I ended up illustrating a hospital building for the site’s splash page, a hospital room and several hospital instruments and medicines to be used throughout the website. I then began researching the site content, what elements actually are used in a hospital and how they are used. I write up a short paragraph about each element and its uses to appear next an illustration of the element in use.</p>
        <p> The website was quick to code using HTML and CSS I wanted to keep it as simple as possible for my demographic.</p>
        
        
<div class="elements">
  <img src="images/Syringe.png" alt="Syringe Icon"  />
  <img src="images/iodine.png" alt="Iodine Icon" class="iodineimg"  />
  <img src="images/thermometer.png" alt="Thermomemeter Icon"  />
</div>
    </div>
        
        
            
 
           
          
        <div class="mydiv1">
        
               <img class="myimage1" src="images/elementmockup.png"/><h3>Final Outcome</h3>
 <p>I ended up with a 7 page website showcasing a range of illustrations I’m quite proud of. I think for children the site is easy to use and visually exciting. Simple information relating to elements relating to the elements uses in a hospital is provided in a few sentences. </p> 
        
        

        <p> I could see several websites being made in this format to help children learn about the elements and how they are used in real life instances they can relate to. This project taught me a lot about catering to your target demographic when building a website. I was able to utilise my illustration skills to translate information which made the site much more appealing for children.</p>
