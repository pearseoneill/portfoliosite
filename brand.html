     <h3>The Brief</h3> 
     
     <p>As I've developed and grown as a designer, my style and tastes have changed. I wanted to rebrand myself. I really like the monogram I have always had but I thought it was time to be updated. I wanted a new colour palette that would be more versatile to be used in different formats. </p>

        <div class="mydiv1">
        
               <img class="myimage1" src="images/2brands1.png"/>
               <h3>My Approach</h3>
 <p>When starting my rebrand I took my orignal monogram into illustrator and started experimenting with it. I broke it done to pure line form, changed some shapes. I then started experimenting with different colour schemes, particularly in block colour. <br>I wanted to move away from using gradients to create a more versatile monogram, I found that my original monogram only worked on very dark backgrounds. </p> 
        
        
        <p>It was important to me though to keep the same colourful visuals for my new brand. <br>I think that a colourful logo not only accurately represents me as a designer and a brand, strong use of colour is always memorable so I wanted to keep that on board.  </p>
        <p> </p>

          <div class="mydiv">

        <img class="myimage" src="images/iconsketch.png"/>
 <p>When I was happy with my new logo and its colour scheme I decided I wanted to add another element to my brand. I wanted to design an icon of myself, an icon self-portrait I guess. <br>I thought an icon of myself would make my brand more personable and it would also showase my illustration skills and brandind skills as I wanted it to fit in with the rest of my brand. <p>
        
            <p>I sketched out lots of different styles to do my icon in. I wanted something that would fit with my monogram as part of my brand, this would require thick lines and strong colours. <br>Once I had a strong idea of what I was going for I went onto Illustrator to design the icon. </p>

        <div class="mydiv1">
        
               <img class="myimage1" src="images/brandmockup.png"/><div class="mydiv4"><h3>Final Outcome</h3>
 <p>I ended up with a new brand I'm really proud of, a revitalised monogram and a new icon that work well together and apart. <br><br>I created a new business card using both of these elements and a brand new CV that makes particular use of the icon. </p> 
        
        
       
        <p> This project showcases my skills in branding and identity design. </p>
